               computation [Gennaro et al. CRYPTO'10] in which a client stores
               private data on an untrusted server and asks the server to
               compute functions over this data. In this scenario we aim to
               achieve three main properties: the server should not learn
               information on inputs and outputs of the computation (privacy),
               the server cannot return wrong results without being caught
               (integrity), and the client can verify the correctness of the
               outputs faster than running the computation (efficiency). A
               known paradigm to solve this problem is to use a (non-private)
               verifiable computation (VC) to prove correctness of a
               homomorphic encryption (HE) evaluation on the ciphertexts.
               Despite the research advances in obtaining efficient VC and HE,
               using these two primitives together in this paradigm is
               concretely expensive. Recent work [Fiore et al. CCS'14, PKC'20]
               addressed this problem by designing specialized VC solutions
               that however require the HE scheme to work with very specific
               parameters; notably HE ciphertexts must be over
               $$\textbackslashmathbb \{Z\}_q$$Zqfor a large prime q.",

               collection of data and is asked to compute a function over it.
               In this scenario, we aim for solutions where the untrusted
               server does not learn information about the data and is
               prevented from cheating. This problem is addressed by verifiable
               and private delegation of computation, proposed by Gennaro,
               Gentry and Parno (CRYPTO'10), a notion that is close to both the
               active areas of homomorphic encryption and verifiable
               computation (VC). However, in spite of the efficiency advances
               in the respective areas, VC protocols that guarantee privacy of
               the inputs are still expensive. The only exception is a protocol
               by Fiore, Gennaro and Pastro (CCS'14) that supports arithmetic
               circuits of degree at most 2. In this paper we propose new
               efficient protocols for VC on encrypted data that improve over
               the state of the art solution of Fiore et al. in multiple
               aspects. First, we can support computations of degree higher
               than 2. Second, we achieve public delegatability and public
               verifiability whereas Fiore et al. need the same secret key to
               encode inputs and verify outputs. Third, we achieve a new
               property that guarantees that verifiers can be convinced about
               the correctness of the outputs without learning information on
               the inputs. The key tool to obtain our new protocols is a new
               SNARK that can efficiently handle computations over a quotient
               polynomial ring, such as the one used by Ring-LWE somewhat
               homomorphic encryption schemes. This SNARK in turn relies on a
               new commit-and-prove SNARK for proving evaluations on the same
               point of several committed polynomials. We propose a
               construction of this scheme under an extractability assumption

               a smaller set of functionalities (i.e., polynomially-bounded

               efficient and easy to implement. Moreover, our schemes can
